# MNIST
This notebook has a model trained on MNIST dataset which contains thousands of images of hand-written numerical digits. To train this model I made a neural network of two layer, and by this I was able to achieve the accuracy of around 94% on test dataset of it. 
### Libraries Used -
 * Pytorch - used for building machine learning models
 * Matplotlib - used for image plotting
 * Numpy - used for some mathematical computations
